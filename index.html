A right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective 'finisher' in limited-overs formats.[4][5][6] He was also the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.[7] Dhoniâ€™s skill in the cricket field has been praised by cricketers such as Kapil Dev, Adam Gilchrist, Nasser Hussain and Kevin Peterson who have often ranked him is as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and captains in the history of the game.[8]

Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. He has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018.[9] Dhoni was named as the captain of the ICC World Test XI in 2009, 2010 and 2013. He has also been selected a record 8 times in ICC World ODI XI teams, 5 times as captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel[10] to Dhoni on 1 November 2011.
